# Simple-Increment-Decrement
This is a very simple project, yet important for me.
I tried building projects using React and Typescript, and that's when I realised that I have some gaps in my knowledge.
So, I took a step back and decided to learn and understand javascript more deeply.
This is the first of many vanilla Javascript projects to come.

Functions:

1.Increment(Add 1 to the value)
2.Decrement(Remove 1 from the value)
3.Reset(Value returns to 0)
